Introduction
=============
A simple direct translation program from Spanish to English.
We decided to use Spanish because all 3 of us have had varying degrees of experience learning it. Spanish is relatively close to English, which was nice for development. Their verb structure is different than English...Adjective-Noun ordering are reversed in Spanish. For example,  "La casa verde" is 'directly' translated to "The house green", while the more fluent translation is "The green house".
